## About {#about}

The Banned Books Collection preserves access to literary works that have been challenged or banned in various school districts. 

To borrow a book, simply browse the collections, find something that interests you, and reach out to the contact email listed for that collection. Borrowing is free and informal - we just ask that you return books within a reasonable time so others can enjoy them too.
